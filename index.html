        <h1>My Favourite Hobby</h1>
        <h2>Gaming in Computer</h2>
        <p>My Hobby is playing games on PC and its enjoyable because we can have fun in it and the mouse is also an item on PC which we use to click on Elements, or move and turn. Its very fun for me as it is my hobby and will bring me out joy in life. I even use PC for other fun and interesting purposes like Whitehatjr, Microsoft excel, Word Document, Coding and more. PC can help us in life and it can even access browsers and search engines. There is even a keyboard to type or move in games and Once we use PC, It will be unforgettable in life. It has got more things like joystick and webcam. there is also a CPU(Central processing unit) and PC wont work at all without it. PC is also having more lag-free than mobile and more comfortable to use. It also has short-cuts to do things like ctrl+C, ctrl+V, ctrl+A, ctrl+X, ctrl+N, alt+f4, ctrl+W and more. S it makes things easier to do in PC. We can also set background-pictures for PC which will make it look better and Headphones can access to it. PC even has internet which is the fastest way to communicate and we can chat and have fun with our friends and others.</p>
